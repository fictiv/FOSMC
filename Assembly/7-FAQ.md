# Frequently Asked Questions

### What engine models are available to use with this design?
M600, M750, S2R 800. M900, later 748’s, and 916’s with a SSS (single-sided swing arm). Some other engines that require a SSS are also doable, but may need some additional modifications.

### How much does it cost to build FOSMC?
The goal of the project was to keep the cost to build at around $10-15k, which is cheaper than most custom jobs. This prototype ran closer to $20k, but with improvements on new versions, and the possibility of producing the parts in batch for interested parties, we can continue to keep the cost as low as possible.
