# Donor Bike Requirements and Suggestions

For the first two FOSMC motorcycles, we have chosen to use early Monsters (620 ie and M900) as the donor bikes.    Monsters have been Ducati's best selling model for many years, thus there is a healthy used bike market with older Monster models being relatively inexpensive and readily available.  However, other Ducati models should work equally well.

The FOSMC design does require two assemblies that are Monster specific: the first being the fuel tank, the other is the swingarm. Should you choose to use a Ducati model other than a Monster, you will need to acquire a Monster fuel tank and Monster swingarm in addition to your donor bike.

The CAD data base currently has provisions to accept mounting of component parts found on first and second generation carbureted Monsters, and fuel injected Monster models up through the 695. We have not explored the feasibility of newer generation of Monsters. Should you decide to explore other Ducati models including newer generation Monsters, please [let us know](mailto:help@fictiv.com) what you discover.

## Here is a list of Ducati specific parts that will be used in construction of the FOSMC:

+ Engine assembly including carburetor of fuel injection system
+ Complete electrical system including all switches, instruments, and lights.
+ Complete oil cooling system (not used on some models)

**Front suspension assembly including:**
+ Forks
+ Triple clamps (note: swap bearings to 55mm OD if using first generation Monster triple clamps with 52mm OD bearings)
+ Wheel assembly
+ Brake assembly
+ Handle bar and all hand controls
+ Headlight
+ Fender (optional)

**Rear suspension assembly including:**
+ Swingarm (specifically steel double-sided as found on first and second generation Monsters)
+ Wheel assembly
+ Brake assembly
+ Fender (optional) 
+ Foot controls from a S2/4R or from first generation Multistrada / Hypermotard. 

_**Note:** aluminum double sided Monster swingarms will not work without design changes to the shock mounts due to the wider width of the arms._

Because the FOSMC frame does not have provisions for mounting of the large Monster type footpeg brackets, Monster foot controls will not work.   S2/4R foot controls are a direct bolt-on with no modifications, and maintain the original Monster footpeg location. Multistrada/ Hyper foot controls will require a small spacer at each side of the swingarm pivot shaft and provide a slightly lower and more forward footpeg position for riders seeking more relaxed / scrambler type foot location. The swingarm pivot shaft for the specific foot control type is also required.

Exhaust system that can be self supporting is required.   Because the FOSMC does not accommodate Monster style footpeg brackets with integrated muffler supports, it is recommended that an exhaust system be used that is solely supported by the engine.   On the first FOSMC bike we adapted short megaphone style mufflers to the original Monster header pipe such that no additional muffler support was required.  FOSMC bike #2 will use an aftermarket exhaust system that mounts solely to the engine and thus also requires no additional mounting provisions.

## Additional Motorcycle Parts - Requirements and Suggestions

There are a few non-Ducati specific parts that are used in the FOSMC construction:

+ **Seat from a Yamaha R6 (03-05 R6 or 06-09 R6S)** - While this may seem like an odd addition to an otherwise Ducati specific motorcycle, the R6 seat mates up to the Ducati Monster fuel tank surprisingly well and will help give the finished bike a very unique look.

+ **Dual rear shocks** - 12.5” to 13.5” eye-to-eye length is preferred. These are commonly available from numerous aftermarket suppliers. The most common application is on vintage “cafe” bikes and on Harley Davidson Sportster models.

+ **Air cleaner pods** - The FOSMC frame does not have provisions for mounting the complete air box assembly, thus individual air cleaner pods are used. The mounting diameter should be matched to your donor bike’s specific intake system.   On fuel injected bikes, two adapter rings may be required and are included in the CAD database. On carbureted Monster models, the front portion of the air box is removed and a support bracket (also included in the CAD database) is provided to support the battery and electrical components mounted to the rear portion of the air box which is retained.
