# FOSMC - Fictiv Open Source Motorcycle
FOSMC is an open source motorcycle that was built to show the power of open innovation + the speed of a distributed manufacturing system. The FOSMC design is based around a Ducati engine, primarily for 2 reasons:

1. Ducati has not changed their engine mount locations since 1993, giving the community 23 years of motorcycles to choose from.
2. Ducati is one of the most iconic brands in motorcycle racing today and frankly we just love them!

# Design Intent
The design challenge was to build a motorcycle that could be assembled in a garage with minimal hand tools—-no welding allowed. Our goal was to empower individuals to create by designing a motorcycle that anyone could assemble and build.

The initial inspiration for FOSMC came from Jack Lennie’s Tinker Bike. However, after further investigation into the design, we found many mechanical flaws that motorcycle experts felt were unsafe. Additionally, the design files for Tinker Bike were not made freely available to the public, despite being promoted as “open source”. So we built our own motorcycle design from scratch!

# Parts
All design files for FOSMC can be found in the CAD folder of this directory and can be fabricated at a local machine shop, in your garage (if you have the equipment), or by Fictiv. :) 

Please reference the Bill of Materials (BOM) for exact details.

# Disclaimer
While the motorcycle can be made street legal in California and is ridable, FOSMC is a prototype. Therefore, we must make the disclaimer that the ultimate safety of the bike is in your hands and you build, assemble, and ride FOSMC at your own risk.
