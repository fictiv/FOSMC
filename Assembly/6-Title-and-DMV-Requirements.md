One of the most common questions in the world of custom bike building is “how do I title and register my new bike?” Here in California most custom built vehicles fall into the category of Specially Constructed Vehicles (SPCNs). The most important aspect is to save your receipts for the purchase of all major components that have gone into the construction. Of course starting with a titled donor bike makes the process a little easier as the existing title covers legal ownership for most of the major components. You will just need to show receipts for raw material that went into construction of the FOSMC frame.

The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) will want to review the receipts for the purpose of assessing a tax value to the vehicle. You will likely be required to have the new motorcycle inspected by California (or your state’s equivalent) Highway Patrol (CHP). The CHP will also review your receipts with the intent of verifying that the vehicle was constructed with parts not taken from stolen vehicles.

Often a brake and light inspection is also required. This inspection is performed by a licensed repair shop authorized to make sure all lights, horn, and other equipment required for legal street use are in operational condition.   

Once all steps have been completed, the DMV will issue a new title. It is likely that “SPCN” will appear as the vehicle make (congratulations, you are now a vehicle manufacturer) and the model year will appear as the year in which the title process is completed.

## Reporting Your Motorcycle to your Insurance Company
Next is to report your vehicle to your insurance company. If your insurer has experience with motorcycles, they should know what to do to process your new SPCN. They will likely need to know the engine size and base rates on this information. They may or may not be willing to offer full comprehensive coverage. At minimum, you should be able to get basic liability coverage which is enough to allow legal operation of your new motorcycle.

This may seem like a new and unusual process, but thousands of folks just like you have built similar projects.
